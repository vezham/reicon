# 🌐 CDN Distribution Directory

This folder holds the compiled, self-contained JavaScript files ready for serving via Content Delivery Networks (like jsDelivr, unpkg, or Vercel edge routes).

## 🗂️ What's Inside

> **Note:** These files are git-ignored and automatically generated during compilation.

* **`vezham-icons.js`**: Core vanilla JS runtime bundle containing all standard icons registered as custom web components (e.g. `<vx-icon icon="arrow-up"></vx-icon>`).
* **`vezham-brands.js`**: Specialized bundle containing custom brand and social media icons.

## 🛠️ How to Generate

1. The raw bundles are built from `packages/icons/scripts/build.cjs` by running:
   ```bash
   npm run build:js
   ```
2. Minified files are generated using Terser:
   ```bash
   npm run build:cdn:min
   ```
   *Alternative:* Run the comprehensive build script `npm run build:packages` which generates and minifies all assets at once.
