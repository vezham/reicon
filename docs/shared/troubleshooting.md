# Troubleshooting

Common issues and their solutions. If you don't find your answer here, open an issue on the [Vezham GitHub Issues tracker](https://github.com/vezham/reicon/issues).

---

## 1. Icons are not rendering (CDN)
Make sure the CDN script is loaded before any `<vx-icon>` elements. Place the script tag in your `<head>` or before your markup.
```html
<!-- ✅ Place in <head> -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@vezham/icons@latest/dist/cdn/vezham-icons.js"></script>
```

---

## 2. Wrong icon weight showing
The `weight` prop uses lowercase values across packages and the CDN. Use `"outline"`, `"filled"`, `"duotone-outline"`, or `"duotone-filled"`.
```jsx
// React / Vue / Svelte / React Native
<Star weight="filled" />
<Star weight="duotone-filled" />

// CDN
<vx-icon icon="star" weight="filled"></vx-icon>
```

---

## 3. TypeScript can't find icon names
Make sure you're importing from the correct package depending on your environment (e.g. `"vezham"` for vanilla JS or `"@vezham/icons-react"` for React). Both packages ship with full type definitions. If autocomplete isn't working, restart your TypeScript server.
```typescript
// ✅ For React projects
import { Home } from '@vezham/icons-react';

// ✅ For vanilla JS projects
import { Home } from '@vezham/icons';
```

---

## 4. Bundle size is too large
Avoid wildcard or star imports — they pull in every icon and defeat tree-shaking.
```javascript
// ❌ Pulls in everything
import * as Icons from '@vezham/icons';

// ✅ Tree-shakeable
import { Home, Bell } from '@vezham/icons';

// ✅ Smallest possible
import Home from 'vezham/icons/Home';
```

---

## 5. Icon color not changing
Icons use `currentColor` by default. If you set a `color` prop, it overrides inheritance. Check that no parent CSS is overriding the color. For Tailwind, use `text-*` utilities on the icon's `className`.
```jsx
// Color via prop
<Heart color="#ef4444" />

// Color via Tailwind
<Heart className="text-red-500" />

// Color via parent inheritance
<div style={{ color: "#ef4444" }}>
  <Heart />  {/* inherits red */}
</div>
```
