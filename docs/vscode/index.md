# Vezham VS Code Extension Guide

Browse, configure, and insert Vezham code snippets directly into your HTML, React, Vue, Svelte, or vanilla JS code from your editor's sidebar panel.

### 1. Installation

Find and install the official extension from the Visual Studio Code Marketplace.

#### Install via Editor Panel:
Open the Extensions panel in VS Code (Cmd+Shift+X or Ctrl+Shift+X), search for **Vezham**, and click install. Or install it via command-line interface:

```bash
code --install-extension Vezham.icons
```

### 2. Workflow & Sidebar Panel

Configure default formats and insert code directly to active files:

1. **Open the Sidebar Explorer**: Click on the **Vezham** logo in the VS Code Activity Bar (located on the left-side toolbar).
2. **Select Code Snippet Format**: Choose your preferred output structure from the dropdown (React, Vue, Svelte, or raw SVG). The picker automatically copies or inserts code matching this selection.
3. **Set Size and Color**: Set custom insertion dimensions (in pixels) and select colors. The selector uses `currentColor` by default, letting your icons auto-adapt to dark and light editor themes.
4. **Click to Insert**: Make sure you have an active code editor window open. Click on any icon card in the sidebar panel. The extension will instantly insert the formatted code snippet at your current text cursor position.
